Hello world!!! This is an example blog post showcasing some of the cool stuff this theme can do. Following is an example blog post written in an mdx file. You can find me @ `content/posts/my-first-post.mdx`. Here you can add/update/delete details and watch the changes live when running in develop mode.

## Using MDX to create blog pages

You can find out more about mdx and how to use it with Gatsby on <Underline>[mdxjs](https://mdxjs.com/getting-started 'MDX JS getting started')</Underline>'s website, and here with <Underline>[Gatsby docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/mdx/ 'Gatsby docs on mdx')</Underline>.

## Using some markdown elements

Here we have a simple js code block.

<CodeBlock
  code={`var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";
alert(s);`}
/>

This is styled by <Underline>[Prism](https://prismjs.com/ 'Prism website')</Underline> via the library <Underline>[Prism React Renderer](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/prism-react-renderer 'Prism React Renderer Library')</Underline>.

You can choose your own theme from this library, currently set to Dracula, in the file `./src/components/ui/code-block.js`.

## Importing images with mdx

Gatsby Cactus Starter supports lazy loading images and the webp format in MDX files.
